Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of the control-plane node running the following command on each as root:

  kubeadm join 172.19.200.188:6443 --token mc868n.na7oxhj9ursnn04g \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:61dcc5490cf3b65e7693657b0913ab054fe6fb53a4995b15b5c2b4c15962bf1d \
    --experimental-control-plane --certificate-key 1deca115ae9665b512adc483d98b10e3d2d2eda76be3e939ceead651d8a0a962

Please note that the certificate-key gives access to cluster sensitive data, keep it secret!
As a safeguard, uploaded-certs will be deleted in two hours; If necessary, you can use
"kubeadm init phase upload-certs --experimental-upload-certs" to reload certs afterward.

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join 172.19.200.188:6443 --token mc868n.na7oxhj9ursnn04g \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:61dcc5490cf3b65e7693657b0913ab054fe6fb53a4995b15b5c2b4c15962bf1d
